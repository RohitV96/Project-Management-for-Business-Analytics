Based on a case study of our choice, we identified and produced a project management plan for a technical/software project that, as a team, we selected. The project was in the initiation stage and was implementing change and adding new services or products.We were able to establish specific project objectives. The project contained requirements for different project resources, including people. It was important to balance the selection of a project with sufficient complexity and size to clearly demonstrate the teamâ€™s understanding of and ability to apply the project management concepts, models, tools, and techniques that we have studied in this course. The project chosen was currently underway and should not be a completed project.
